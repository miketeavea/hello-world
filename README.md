Storing useful snippets and scripts as I learn, like this masterpiece:

import time

def dun(play_count):
  n=0
  while True:
    if n <= play_count:
      print("DUN")
      n=n+1
    else:
      break

print("In the customer success system, inefficiencies in processes are considered especially heinous. The men and women who investigate these issues are part of an elite squad known as the optimization team.")
time.sleep(2)
print("These are their stories.")
time.sleep(1)

dun(2)
